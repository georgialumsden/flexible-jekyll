The Rosie Result is the third and final book in the trilogy beginning with The Rosie Project. The series follows around a university genetics professor, Don Tillman, who lives with autism but isn’t quite aware of it. Throughout the books, he meets Rosie and experiences a life that he would have never predicted for himself. The books are humorous and eye-opening to all the ways that different individuals view the world. 
I loved all of the books! The second one was frustrating from the readers point of view and I relied heavily on the third book to redeem the series for me. Luckily it did. The books were so well written leaving it up to the imagination to visualize the characters but guiding the reader through Don’s life. It felt almost educational while reading them but in a very light-hearted way. The author did an awesome job of addressing a serious topic very appropriately. 
After reading the stories, I feel like I took away from it that everyone is trying their best. But most importantly, everyone is different and it is important to try to not criticize people for that. Don was a very lovable character and it showed how easy people are to judge off of physical attributes. The alignment of the storyline to real life was very well done to pass along a positive message.
Don was by far my favourite character. I also liked Rosie but mainly through the eyes of Don. I wouldn’t say I have a favourite part in any of the books. I enjoyed all the feel-good moments though. 
My least favourite part was the ending of the second book. The entire second book entailed a lot of frustrating issues that I hoped would be resolved by the end. However, when the book finished, I felt ripped off by the ending and I knew I had to read the third book to figure out what the long-term outcome ended up being.
All of the books were really easy to read so I would recommend them to anyone who wants a good story to read in their free time. Specifically if anyone is stressed by life events, READ this series. It fills your time with happiness, growth and intellectual thought. 
My rating: 4.5/5
