Overall, I found tremendous amounts of interest in this story and I would love to read more like it. Delia Owens did a great job of giving the readers a stimulating read through connecting a murder mystery and a fictional biography. I would recommend this book to anyone that wants to sit down with a book and not get back up until it is done.
