This book is about two girls, Daisy and Agnes, from wildly different countries, Canada and Gilead, and how they come to find out some life-changing news. The story is told through testaments of the two girls and a written account by Aunt Lydia. The characters tell a compelling story and provide two views on a single situation that make it all the more interesting.

I LOVED the book, wow. It exceeded all my expectations. Not only was it written incredibly well with an intriguing storyline, but it included many unexpected turns to the story that made me not want to put down the book. I have previously read The Handmaid’s Tale which is also set in Gilead so I had context of the setting but I don’t think reading The Handmaid’s Tale first is necessary. I also don’t think The Handmaid’s Tale does this book justice, The Testaments is so much better in my opinion.

I think Agnes ended up being my favourite character. Both girls had crazy character development but I liked Agnes’ storyline a little better than Daisy’s. I also liked reading about the setting of Gilead more than Canada so that probably played a role in liking Agnes more. My favourite part was probably when Agnes deceived Paula and got enrolled at Ardua Hall. In general, I found the second half of the book to be very compelling and hard to put down at some points. 

I recommend this book to everyone! Although it was female based, I think anyone could appreciate the story and find it enjoyable to read. Like I previously said, I would definitely recommend this book before The Handmaid’s Tale so I highly recommend those who have read The Handmaid’s Tale to read this. I love the way Margaret Atwood writes and told this story. I loved it!

My rating: 5/5
